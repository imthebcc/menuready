## FASTEST METHOD: YELP MESSAGE

### 3 Steps (2 minutes):

**1. Go to Yelp listing**
```
https://yelp.com/biz/[restaurant-name]
```

**2. Click "Message the Business"**

**3. Send this:**
```
Hi! 👋

I came across your Yelp page and noticed you could benefit from a 
structured digital menu.

I went ahead and built one for you using your existing menu photos.

Preview it here (free, no signup):
[PREVIEW LINK]

If you like it:
✓ Publish instantly (FREE)
✓ Upgrade to Done-For-You ($49 - I'll submit it to Yelp for you)

Let me know if you have questions!

- Remi
MenuReady
```

**Done.** They'll respond within 1-2 days (30-40% response rate).

## ALTERNATIVE: INSTAGRAM DM

### If Yelp message unavailable:

**1. Find their Instagram**
- Check Yelp listing for @username
- Google "[Restaurant Name] instagram"

**2. Send DM:**
```
Hey [Restaurant Name]! 👋

Saw your page and built you a free digital menu using your existing 
menu photos from Yelp.

Check it out: [PREVIEW LINK]

You can publish it instantly (free) or I can handle Yelp submission 
for you ($49).

No strings attached - just want to help local restaurants!

Let me know if you want to see it live 🙌
```

## WHY THIS WORKS BETTER THAN EMAIL

**Email problems:**
- ❌ Hard to find email addresses
- ❌ Goes to spam
- ❌ Low open rate (~10%)
- ❌ Takes longer to find contact info

**Yelp/Instagram advantages:**
- ✅ Restaurants check daily
- ✅ No searching for contact info
- ✅ Higher response rate (30-40% vs 10%)
- ✅ More casual/friendly
- ✅ Instant delivery

## RESPONSE RATES

| Method | Response Rate | Time to Find Contact | Total Time |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| Yelp Message | 30-40% | 0 sec (already have link) | 2 min |
| Instagram DM | 20-30% | 1 min (search) | 3 min |
| Email | 10-20% | 3-5 min (find email) | 6-8 min |

**Yelp = fastest + best results**

**Day 1:** Send initial message  
**Day 3:** First follow-up if no response
