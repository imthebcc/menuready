2. Click "Message the Business" button
3. Paste template below
4. Replace [PREVIEW LINK] with actual link
5. Send

### Yelp Message Template:

```
Hi! 👋

I came across your Yelp page and noticed you could benefit from a structured digital menu.

I went ahead and built one for you using your existing menu photos.

Preview it here (free, no signup):
[PREVIEW LINK]

If you like it:
✓ Publish instantly (FREE)
✓ Upgrade to Done-For-You ($49 - I'll submit it to Yelp for you)

Let me know if you have questions!

### Variations:

**If they have low rating (<4.0):**
```
Hi! 👋

I noticed your Yelp page could use a structured digital menu to help boost customer experience.

I built one for you using your existing menu photos - check it out:
[PREVIEW LINK]

A clear menu can improve reviews and order accuracy. It's free to publish, or I can handle Yelp submission for $49.

Interested?

```

**If they have no digital menu on Yelp:**
```
Hey! 👋

Saw you don't have a digital menu on Yelp yet. I went ahead and built one for you using your menu photos from reviews.

Preview: [PREVIEW LINK]

Takes 2 minutes to publish (free), or I can do it for you ($49).

Let me know!

## METHOD 2: INSTAGRAM DM

### Why Instagram?
- ✅ Good for modern/younger restaurant owners
- ✅ More visual platform (show before/after)
- ✅ High engagement rate
- ✅ Can see if they're active (recent posts)

### How to Find Instagram:

1. Check Yelp listing (often has Instagram handle)
2. Google "[Restaurant Name] instagram"
3. Look for @username in bio or reviews

---

### Instagram DM Template:

```
Hey [Restaurant Name]! 👋

Saw your page and built you a free digital menu using your existing menu photos from Yelp.

Check it out: [PREVIEW LINK]

You can publish it instantly (free) or I can handle Yelp submission for you ($49).

No strings attached - just want to help local restaurants!

Let me know if you want to see it live 🙌
```

**Character count:** ~270 (fits Instagram DM)

---

### Instagram Story Mention (Alternative):

If they're very active on Instagram:

1. Screenshot their Yelp menu photos
2. Screenshot your digital version
3. Create before/after image
4. Post to your story
5. Tag them: "@[restaurant]"
6. DM them: "Just tagged you in a story - built your digital menu!"

**Higher engagement** but more work.

---

## METHOD 3: CONTACT FORM (FALLBACK)

If Yelp message unavailable and no Instagram:

### Contact Form Template:

```
Subject: Free digital menu for [Restaurant Name]

Best,
Remi
